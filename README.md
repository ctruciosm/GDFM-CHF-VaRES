Reproducible codes for Hallin and Trucíos (2020)' paper. The main codes are in this repository. Additional matlab codes from the [MFE](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/code/matlab/mfe-toolbox/) Toolbox of Kevin Sheppard as well as [GDFM](http://www.barigozzi.eu/Codes.html) codes available in the Matteo Barigozzi website are also needed.


## Paper's abstract 
Beyond their importance from a regulatory policy point of view, Value-at-Risk and Expected shortfall play an important role in risk management, portfolio allocation, capital level requirements, trading systems, and hedging strategies. Unfortunately, their accurate estimation in large portfolios is quite a challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. To tackle this problem, we propose a filtered historical simulation method in which high-dimensional conditional covariance matrices  are estimated via  a general dynamic factor model with infinite-dimensional factor space and conditionally heteroscedastic factors (Trucíos et al., 2020). The procedure is applied to a panel with  concentration ratio close to one and our results reveal that both risk measures are accurately estimated under our method, which outperforms   alternative approaches available in the literature.
